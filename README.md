# FileEncryption

FileEncryption is a Java application that provides a simple GUI interface for encrypting and decrypting files using XOR-based encryption. This application allows you to select a file, specify an encryption/decryption key, and perform the encryption or decryption operation.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI interface for easy file selection and key input.
- XOR-based encryption/decryption algorithm.
- Supports encryption and decryption of various file types.
- Instant feedback on the encryption/decryption process.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

## Getting Started

To use the FileEncryption application, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1. Clone or download the project from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SinhaAmrit/FileEncryption).
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.

## Usage

1. Run the `FileEncryption` class, which contains the main method.
2. A window titled "File Encryption" will appear.
3. Enter the encryption/decryption key in the provided text field.
4. Click the "Select File" button to choose the file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
5. The selected file will be encrypted or decrypted using the specified key.
6. Once the process is complete, a message dialog will display "Done!".

**Note**: Encryption and decryption use the same key. Make sure to remember the key used for encryption to decrypt the file successfully.

## Example

Here's an example scenario to demonstrate how to use the FileEncryption application:

1. Launch the FileEncryption application.
2. Enter the key "123" in the text field.
3. Click the "Select File" button and choose a file named "example.txt".
4. The file "example.txt" will be encrypted using the key "123".
5. To decrypt the file, run the application again, enter the key "123", and select the encrypted file.
6. The application will decrypt the file, and the original content will be restored.
